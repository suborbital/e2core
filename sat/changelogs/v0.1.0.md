## Welcome to Sat Beta-1!

This has been a long time coming. Sat is our tiny WebAssembly edge compute server that can handle anything from simple command-line tasks to globally distributed production workloads.

Sat has been in the works for many months as an experiment. We're ready to get everyone's input on Sat as an edge compute powerhouse by releasing it in beta!

An overview of what Sat can do:
- Run Wasm modules (built from every language we support) as a server or a command-line tool
- Statically compile into a minimal binary (or a minimal container image)
- Mesh with a 'constellation' of peers to serve entire applications
- Utilise the entirety of Suborbital's Runnable API to provide secure capabilities to your code

We'd love your feedback, so please let us know how Sat performs for you!
