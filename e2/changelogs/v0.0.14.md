## Welcome to Subo Alpha-14!

Subo Alpha-14 is required for use with Atmo Beta-2.

Subo now creates bundles by default when building, with the added `--no-bundle` flag if you would like to skip.

This release will also create a git repo automatically when creating a new project.

This release will create Runnables with API version 0.9.1 and use Atmo version 0.2.0 for the `dev` server.
