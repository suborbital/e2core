# Subo Beta-1

Welcome to the first beta of the Subo CLI! This project has remained in Alpha for a long time while we improved its usability, compatibility with language toolchains, and integrated it with our [Compute](https://suborbital.dev/compute) product. We think it's ready, so it's being elevated to Beta status! We'll continue to make improvements along the way, but we believe it's the best way to work with WebAssembly codebases and all of our projects/products.
