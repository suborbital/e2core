Subo Beta-2.2 brings several bug fixes and new features.

Features:
- Subo now automatically checks for updates and notifies you if one is available (big thank you to @denopink for this!)
- Subo's proxy port (when running `subo compute deploy`) can now be configured with the `--proxy-port` flag

Fixes:
- Fixed a bug where Subo would crash when building a single Runnable with the `--docker` flag (#102)
